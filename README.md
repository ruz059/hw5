# Portfolio Website Updates

## Recent Enhancements

### Content & Structure Improvements
- **Awards & Leadership page**: Restructured with clear hierarchy using nested lists for better readability
- **Home page**: Added more HTML content and improved layout structure  
- **Pages simplified**: Removed the Values page as it didn't fully align with my portfolio focus

### Theme System Overhaul

**Key changes:**
- make to ~200 lines while maintaining clear functionality
- Text colors automatically adjust for proper contrast against backgrounds
- Green remains the primary accent across all themes for consistency

**Design philosophy shift:**
Instead of unlimited customization (which often leads to poor design choices), I created three well-tested themes that maintain:
- **Accessibility standards** (WCAG contrast ratios)
- **Visual harmony** (coordinated color palettes)
- **Color consistency** (green as primary accent in all themes)

The result: improved viewer experience with more maintainable code.
